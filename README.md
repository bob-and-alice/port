This program is a simple but powerful network tool designed to help you scan ports on your machine or any other machine over the internet. Whether you're a developer trying to ensure that your server is configured correctly, or just a curious user wanting to check if certain ports are open or closed, this script has got you covered.

The tool lets you choose between different modes of operation:

    Scan a Specific Port: You can enter a specific port number, and the program will check if that port is open or closed on your public IP address.

    Scan Favorite Ports: If you frequently check certain ports (like port 80 for HTTP or port 22 for SSH), you can quickly scan a predefined list of common ports.

    Scan a Range of Ports: For more advanced users, you can scan a range of ports to see which ones are open. This can be helpful when you're performing a more thorough check of the system’s network configuration.

The program also automatically detects your public IP address by fetching it from an external service. After that, it starts checking the ports, providing clear feedback with color-coded results. Green means a port is open, and red means it’s closed. This gives you instant insights into your network’s accessibility.

It’s a lightweight script that runs on Linux (GNU) systems and is built to be fast and simple. If you want to check if your server or device is ready for certain types of network connections, this script is a great way to get that information quickly.
